# ========================================
# Admin User Configuration
# ========================================
# Use these to configure admin accounts when running:
#   node scripts/create_firebase_auth_admins.js
#
# This creates users in Firebase Authentication (persistent across deployments)
# Only users with both EMAIL and PASSWORD set will be created.
# You can omit any role you don't need.

# Administrator Account (Full access)
ADMIN_NAME=Admin User
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@vserve.gov.ph
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@2024!Secure
ADMIN_DEPARTMENT=IT Administration

# Viewer Account (Read-only access)
VIEWER_NAME=Viewer User
VIEWER_EMAIL=viewer@vserve.gov.ph
VIEWER_PASSWORD=Viewer@2024!Secure
VIEWER_DEPARTMENT=Building Permits

# SECURITY NOTES:
# - Users are created in Firebase Authentication (not just Firestore)
# - Firebase Auth handles password hashing securely (scrypt-based)
# - Users persist across deployments - no need to re-seed!
# - DELETE the .env file after creating users for security!
# - Never commit .env to version control
