// Firebase/Firestore implementation of UserManagementService
// For now, we use the HTTP version for simplicity since user management
// doesn't require real-time updates as critically as feedback does.

// Re-export HTTP implementation as the Firebase version
// This allows us to use the service factory pattern without code duplication
